# ZS_WeiDuLibraries

Contains libraries of WeiDu functions or code that I use for modding the IE games. Some of the code are functions written by me, others just functions from others (Argent77, Ardanis, CamDawg, DavidW, SubtleDoctor) that I've compiled due to their usefulness.

Some of the ones I wrote are incomplete (as in, they don't cover all the uses cases), a few of them are untested or unfinished. Most are functional. Pending to add proper documentation wherever it's needed.

To use these functions you must ensure that their function dependencies are in order, otherwise, they won't run. For example, my functions that add effects to items and spells directly depend on Argent77's functions.

All these functions run fine when they are included together. I suggest putting them in an ALWAYS block if you're planning on writing a script for modding.
